# Cat and Dog Image Classification using TensorFlow

This project demonstrates how to build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is trained on the Bingsu/Cat_and_Dog dataset from Hugging Face.

## Features

- Data loading and preprocessing
- Model architecture using CNN
- Training with callbacks (ModelCheckpoint, EarlyStopping)
- Evaluation on test set
- Visualization of training history and results
- Function to predict on new images

## Requirements

- tensorflow
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab
2. Run all cells to train and evaluate the model
3. Use the `predict_image` function to classify new images

## Results

The model achieves [insert your best accuracy] accuracy on the test set. 

## Future Improvements

- Data augmentation
- Transfer learning with pre-trained models
- Hyperparameter tuning
